## My homework for the C# Professional course, less-14_pro_Task_Parallel_Library
1. Create an array of numbers with dimensions of 1,000,000 or more. Using a random number generator, initialize this
    array of values. Create a PLINQ query that will allow you to get all the odd numbers from the original array.
2. Create two methods that will be executed as part of parallel tasks. Arrange to call these methods when
    help Invoke so that the main thread of the program (the Main method) does not stop its execution.
